# Agent Installation

The Agent runs on Incus hosts. It reports host resources, instance state and traffic data, and helps the panel complete delivery workflows.

## Host OS

The host install script is recommended for Ubuntu 22.04+ and Debian 12/13. Debian 11 remains best-effort compatible, but it is not recommended for new hosts. Debian 10 and earlier are rejected by the installer.

## Panel Certificate Trust

The host install script imports the panel Incus client certificate into the host Incus trust list as `panel`. If the panel is reinstalled, migrated, restored from disaster recovery, or has its client certificate regenerated, the host may still trust an old `panel` certificate. Admin storage-pool creation or resource reads can then fail with `not authorized`.

When this happens, generate a fresh host install command from the admin console and run it again on the host. The current installer downloads the latest panel certificate first, then replaces the existing `panel` trust entry on the host.

## Release Configuration

```dotenv
INCUDAL_AGENT_RELEASE_REPOSITORY=cytusc/payincus
INCUDAL_AGENT_RELEASE_TOKEN=
```

If GitHub Agent releases are not available yet, use a local release directory:

```dotenv
INCUDAL_AGENT_RELEASE_DIR=/opt/incudal/agent-release
```

The Agent installer reads `https://<panel>/api/agent/manifest.json` and selects the `linux-amd64` or `linux-arm64` binary for the host. If installation fails with `agent manifest does not contain linux-amd64 binary metadata`, the installer is likely too old to parse the compact single-line JSON manifest served by the panel. Update the panel to a version that includes the Agent manifest parser fix, then copy a fresh Agent install command from the admin console.

If backend logs show the install token was consumed but the Agent remains offline, and the Nginx access log shows `/api/agent/binary/...gz?v=<timestamp>` returning HTTP 400, the old installer is using the backend-reserved `v` query parameter for binary cache busting. Update the panel to a version that includes the Agent binary download query fix, confirm the public `install.sh` uses `cache_bust` for binary URLs, then copy a fresh Agent install command from the admin console.

## Resource And Log Limits

The Agent reports every 60 seconds by default, with a 30-second minimum. Do not lower the interval to values such as 5 seconds. On hosts with many instances, each heartbeat reads host resources, running instance state and traffic counters, so high-frequency polling can increase Incus API and host CPU pressure.

The current Agent includes these protections:

- At most 500 instances are reported per heartbeat.
- Incus instance state reads are limited to concurrency 3.
- Non-running instances do not trigger extra `/state` requests.
- Successful heartbeat logs are throttled to the first entry and about one entry every 10 minutes; failed heartbeat logs are throttled to the first entry and about one entry per minute.
- The generated `incudal-agent.service` includes `CPUQuota=20%`, `MemoryMax=256M`, `TasksMax=128`, `LogRateLimitIntervalSec=30s` and `LogRateLimitBurst=120`.

If a host was installed with an older Agent, update the panel, copy a fresh Agent install command from the admin console, and run it once on the host. Binary self-upgrade alone cannot rewrite an old systemd service; rerunning the installer refreshes the binary, config and systemd resource/log limits.

## Local Build

```bash
cd agent
go test ./...
cd ..
bash agent/scripts/build-release.sh
```
